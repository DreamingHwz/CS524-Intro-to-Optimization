    "## 1. Network Reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider a telecommunications network with a given pattern of interconnections. This network consists of eleven sites connected by bidirectional lines for data transmission. Each line has a bandwidth (i.e. maximum rate for data transmission) of 1.0. We are interested in the total bandwidth for the connection between nodes 10 and 11, and what happens to this bandwidth if a node is eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a)** Formulate the problem as a maxflow problem and solve. (Hint: Each bidirectional line can be represented by two directional edges, one in each direction. That is, if there is a line connecting nodes i and j, then [i,j] and [j,i] are both edges in the edge set. See the definition  of the set \"edges\" in the starter file.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** By adjusting your model for part (a), **not** recoding the edge set from scratch, find what happens if node 3 is eliminated from the graph. (That is, all lines connected to node 3 can no longer carry data.) What is the new maximum bandwidth between nodes 10 and 11?\n",
    "\n",
    "**(c)** Can your maxflow problem be reformulated more compactly by using birectional lines? That is, redefining the edge set by eliminating duplicated lines (see the starter code) while allowing data to flow in either direction. Write down your reformulation of part (a) and code and solve it in Julia.\n"
