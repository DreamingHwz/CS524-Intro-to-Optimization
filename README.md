# CS524-Intro-to-Optimization
I took this course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison during the Spring 2023 semester, instructed by Professor Stephen J. Wright. This repository is a compilation of homework assignments including our final project. The primary programming language used is Julia, with optimization solvers such as HiGHS, Ipopt, and Gurobi.


Our final project revolves around solving Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) and Mixed-Integer Second-Order Cone Programming (MISOCP) problems using the powerful Gurobi optimization solver. We successfully determined the ideal apartment location in Madison, taking into account factors such as living convenience, proximity to supermarkets, campus, bus stops, and more.
