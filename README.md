# CS524-Intro-to-Optimization
I took this course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison during the Spring 2023 semester, instructed by Professor Stephen J. Wright. This repository is a collection of homework assignments including our final project, mainly written in Julia with optimization solvers like HiGHS, Ipopt, and Gurobi. 

## final project
It solved Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP) and Mixed-Integer Second-Order Cone Programming (MISOCP) problems using the powerful Gurobi optimization solver, successfully determined the ideal apartment location in Madison, considering living convenience, proximity to supermarkets, campus, bus stops, and more.
